Finite Element Method for Differential and Difference Equations
================================================

Algorithm solves differential equation with boundary conditions using finite element method. It finds Equation of Acoustic Material Vibrations with provided by the user precision. 
It was a part of AGH UST Differential and Difference Equations subject.


Technologies used
================================================
C++ - Eigen for matrix calculations
Python - Pandas and Matplotlib for plots genration

Setup and launch
================================================
<ul>
    <li>make sure you have installed a C++ compiler and Eigen library, Python with Pandas, Matplotlib </li>
    <li>navigate to project directory</li>
    <li>compile main.cpp with your compiler and include Eigen library during compilation</li>
    <li>excecute created  .exe file</li>
    <li>enter expected precision</li>
</ul>
Results will be saved in data.csv file.
