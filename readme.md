Finite Element Method for Differential and Difference Equations
================================================

Algorithm solves differential equation with boundary conditions using finite element method. It finds Equation of Acoustic Material Vibrations with provided by the user precision. 
It was a part of AGH UST Differential and Difference Equations subject.


Technologies used
================================================
C++ - Eigen for matrix calculations

Setup and launch
================================================
<ul>
    <li>make sure you have installed a c++ compiler and Eigen library</li>
    <li>navigate to project directory</li>
    <li>compile main.cpp with your compiler and include Eigen library during compilation</li>
    <li>execute created  .exe file</li>
    <li>enter expected precision</li>
</ul>
Results will be saved in data.txt file.
